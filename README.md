Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have coded the main homepage for the calendar website. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to load javascript code/animations onto the pages in the html code, so when prompt, javascript code will load. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Overall no problem so far, the setup/layout of the website may need some work as the apperance of the coded website is kind of off (margins is too wide/narrow, spacing is not uniform, header takes up too much of page). This may take a while to test and fix up to make it look nice.
